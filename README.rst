SQLAlchemy-FoundationDB
========================

SQLAlchemy-FoundationDB provides a `SQLAlchemy <http://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_
dialect for the FoundationDB SQL Layer, as well as
a Core/ORM extension library allowing direct control of FoundationDB SQL nested
SELECT statements and result sets.

The library requires the ``foundationdb-sql`` package to be installed, as well as the
``psycopg2`` database API.
